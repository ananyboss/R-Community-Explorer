A final 📦 worth mentioning here is #pkgdown. 

#roxygen2 makes it easy to create documentation, but it's the kind you'd get by typing ?coord_map in your #rstats session.

To get the *web* docs, *also* use #pkgdown. It's very easy + used by 5k+ 📦s.

"11/12

Finally, the #python library that's analogous to #rstats's #pkgdown is #sphinx.

Just like pkgdown is used for all the #tidyverse docs, sphinx powers the Python docs. It's pretty nice.

I found this quick-start tutorial by @eikonomega very helpful:

One of the best parts of these docs is the @examples tag. Include working code, and #rstats will run it + include the results in your docs!

\"This is a very important part of the documentation because many people look at the examples first.\"

"5/12

A bonus of adding examples to your documentation is that, as #rstats runs your code, it also tests that it runs.

It's not as comprehensive as using a full test suite like #testthat (that's worth its own thread someday), but it's a practical way to get into testing code.","20163265","1260911777702916097",2020-05-14 12:36:09,1

Whereas in #rstats there's just 1 convention, #roxygen2, in #python there are at least 2 common easy to read styles of docstring: #numpy-style + Google-style.

I prefer Google's style, so that's what I used. You can find more examples here:

Yesterday I learned #python has rough analogs for all of these. Here's a toy example of a *docstring*, the equivalent of #rstats's #roxygen2 comments.
